# VAT for Directors: Registering & Schemes

<div className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mb-8">April 6, 2025 • 6 min read</div>

Value Added Tax (VAT) is often seen as a headache, but for some IT contractors and consultants, it can actually generate profit.

---

## The Thresholds

*   **Compulsory Registration:** If your "taxable turnover" exceeds **£90,000** in a rolling 12-month period.
*   **Voluntary Registration:** You can register even if you earn £1.

### Why Register Voluntarily?
1.  **Credibility:** It makes you look like a larger, established business.
2.  **Reclaiming VAT:** If you buy expensive laptops/equipment, you can reclaim the 20% VAT on costs.
3.  **Flat Rate Scheme Profit:** (See below).

## The Flat Rate Scheme (FRS)

Designed to simplify VAT for small businesses (turnover under £150k).
*   **Standard:** You charge 20% output tax, reclaim 20% input tax. Pay the difference to HMRC.
*   **Flat Rate:** You charge 20% to the client. You pay a lower fixed % to HMRC. You reclaim *nothing* on expenses (usually).

### The "Profit" Trick
*   **Sector:** "Computer Consultant".
*   **FRS Rate:** 14.5% (You get a 1% discount in Year 1 = 13.5%).
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   Invoice Client: £1,000 + £200 VAT = £1,200.
    *   Pay HMRC (14.5% of gross): £1,200 * 14.5% = **£174**.
    *   **Difference:** You keep **£26**.

On £100,000 turnover, this "VAT Surplus" is **£2,600** of pure extra profit.
*   *Note:* The surplus counts as taxable income for Corporation Tax.

### The "Limited Cost Trader" Trap
If you spend less than 2% of turnover on goods (software/services don't count), you are a "Limited Cost Trader".
*   **Rate:** **16.5%**.
*   **Result:** The profit virtually disappears (16.5% of gross is almost exactly 20% of net).
*   Most pure IT contractors fall into this trap now.

## Making Tax Digital (MTD)
You cannot use a spreadsheet and type figures into the HMRC website anymore.
You **must** use MTD-compatible software (Xero, FreeAgent, QuickBooks) to file quarterly returns.

## Summary
*   **Register** if you hit £90k.
*   **Consider FRS** only if you buy goods (to avoid Limited Cost Trader status).
*   **Software** is mandatory.

*Disclaimer: VAT rules are rigid. Late filing penalties are automated.*
