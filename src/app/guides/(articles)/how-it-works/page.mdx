# Inside the Engine: How We Calculate Your Tax

<div className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mb-8">April 6, 2025 • 8 min read</div>

Transparency is key to trust. Unlike "black box" calculators, we believe you should know exactly how your numbers are derived. Here is the logic powering the **Director Salary vs Dividend Optimization Engine**.

## 1. The Hierarchy of Tax
Our engine applies deductions in a strict legal order:
1.  **Revenue Deductions:** Expenses, Salary, and Employer NIC are deducted first to find **Taxable Profit**.
2.  **Corporation Tax:** Applied to Taxable Profit using 2025/26 thresholds (19% / 25% / Marginal).
3.  **Distributable Profit:** The post-tax profit limits the maximum dividend you can legally take.
4.  **Personal Tax:** Salary and Dividends are combined.
    *   Salary uses the Personal Allowance first.
    *   Dividends utilize the Dividend Allowance (£500).
    *   Bands (Basic/Higher/Additional) are applied to the remainder.

## 2. National Insurance Assumptions
We use the **Annual Earnings Period** for Directors.
*   **Primary Threshold:** £12,570.
*   **Secondary Threshold:** £5,000 (The new lower limit for 2025/26).
*   **Rate:** 15% for Employers.

## 3. Student Loans
We calculate Student Loan repayment based on **Adjusted Net Income** (Salary + Dividends) exceeding the plan threshold.
*   *Note:* We apply the calculation to the *entire* excess, as per Self Assessment rules.

## 4. Marginal Relief
Many calculators use a flat 19% or 25%. We use the full HMRC formula:
`((Upper Limit - Profits) * Fraction) - Standard Tax`
This ensures that if you earn £51,000, you pay the correct marginal rate, not a flat 25%.
