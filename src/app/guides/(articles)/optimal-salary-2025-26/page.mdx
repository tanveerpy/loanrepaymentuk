# Optimal Director Salary 2025/26: The Definitive Guide

<div className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mb-8">April 6, 2025 • 12 min read</div>

For the 2025/26 tax year, the "Optimal Salary" question has become significantly more complex. In previous years, the advice was simple: Pay up to the Primary Threshold (£12,570).

**This year is different.**

The government has reduced the **Secondary Threshold (Employer NICs)** from £9,100 down to **£5,000**.
At the same time, the **Employer NIC Rate** has risen to **15%**.

This creates a "Tax Trap" between £5,000 and £12,570 where you pay Employer NICs, even though you pay no Employee NICs.

This guide explores the three main strategies:
1.  **The Standard:** £12,570 (Best for Multi-Employee companies).
2.  **The Secondary Limit:** £5,000 (Best for Sole Directors?).
3.  **The Lower Earnings Limit:** £6,396 (Pension Qualifying).

## The Landscape: Key Thresholds 2025/26

To understand the strategy, you must know the numbers:

| Threshold | Annual Amount | What Happens Here? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Secondary Threshold (ST)** | **£5,000** | Employer NICs (15%) start. |
| **Lower Earnings Limit (LEL)** | **£6,396** | You get a "Qualifying Year" for State Pension (without paying NIC). |
| **Primary Threshold (PT)** | **£12,570** | Employee NICs (8%) start. |
| **Personal Allowance (PA)** | **£12,570** | Income Tax (20%) starts. |

### The Goal
We want to extract money from the company while minimizing the combined total of:
*   Corporation Tax (CT).
*   Employer National Insurance (ER NIC).
*   Employee National Insurance (EE NIC).
*   Personal Income Tax.

---

## Strategy A: The £12,570 Salary
*(Traditionally the most popular)*

**Who includes this?** Companies with 2+ employees (or Husband/Wife teams) eligible for the **Employment Allowance**.

### How It Works
You pay yourself £12,570.
*   **Income Tax:** £0 (covered by Personal Allowance).
*   **Employee NIC:** £0 (You are exactly at the threshold).
*   **Employer NIC:** £1,135 (Calculated on £12,570 - £5,000 = £7,570 @ 15%).

**The Employment Allowance Magic:**
If you are eligible, the Employment Allowance covers the £1,135 bill. The cost to the company is **£0**.
Plus, the full £12,570 is a deductible expense, saving you **£2,388 - £3,142** in Corporation Tax (depending on your rate).

**Verdict:** ✅ **THE WINNER** (If Employment Allowance Eligible).

## Strategy B: The £5,000 Salary (Sole Directors)
*(The new contender for 2025/26)*

**Who includes this?** Sole Directors who cannot claim Employment Allowance.

If a Sole Director pays £12,570, they must physically pay the **£1,135** Employer NIC bill to HMRC.
Is it worth paying £1,135 in NIC to save ~£2,400 in Corporation Tax?
*   **Net Saving:** Yes, theoretically ~£1,265.
*   ** BUT:** It creates admin. You have to run payroll monthly and pay HMRC.

**The £5,000 Option:**
*   You pay £5,000.
*   **Employer NIC:** £0.
*   **Employee NIC:** £0.
*   **Income Tax:** £0.
*   **Admin:** Minimal (often annual filing).

**The Major Downside:**
£5,000 is **BELOW** the Lower Earnings Limit (£6,396).
*   ❌ **You DO NOT earn a State Pension qualifying year.**
*   ❌ **You waste £7,570 of your tax-free Personal Allowance.**

**Verdict:** ⚠️ **RISKY.** Only use if you have a full State Pension record already or other income sources (e.g. Pension/Rental) that use up your allowances.

---

## Strategy C: The "Pension Qualifying" Salary (£6,396)
*(The Sweet Spot?)*

**Who includes this?** Sole Directors wanting State Pension credits.

You pay yourself exactly the Lower Earnings Limit: **£6,396**.
*   **Employer NIC:** On (£6,396 - £5,000) = £1,396 @ 15% = **£209.40**.
*   **State Pension:** ✅ You get your credit!
*   **Personal Allowance:** You still waste ~£6,000 of it.

**Verdict:** A middle ground, but often mathematically inferior to taking the hit on Strategy A.

---

## The "Hiring a Spouse" Strategy

This is the most effective tax planning tool for typical family businesses.
*   Sole Directors are blocked from the £10,500 Employment Allowance.
*   BUT, if you employ a spouse (for genuine work) and pay them above the Secondary Threshold (£5,000), you become a "Multi-Employee" company.
*   **Boom:** You unlock the allowance.

### The Perfect Scenario:
1.  **Director Salary:** £12,570.
2.  **Spouse Salary:** £12,570.
3.  **Total Employer NIC:** £2,270.
4.  **Employment Allowance:** Covers the full £2,270.
5.  **Corporation Tax Deduction:** £25,140 salary expense saves **~£4,776** in Corp Tax.

## Comparison Table: Sole Director (No Employment Allowance)

| Salary | CT Saving (19%) | Employer NIC Cost | Net Benefit | State Pension? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **£12,570** | £2,388 | -£1,135 | **+£1,253** | ✅ Yes |
| **£9,100** | £1,729 | -£615 | **+£1,114** | ✅ Yes |
| **£6,396** | £1,215 | -£209 | **+£1,006** | ✅ Yes |
| **£5,000** | £950 | £0 | **+£950** | ❌ No |

**(CT Saving is based on the salary being a deductible expense).**

**Analysis:**
Even though paying £12,570 incurs a £1,135 NIC bill, the Corporation Tax saving (at 19%) outweighs it.
*   If your company pays 25% Corp Tax, the benefit is even *higher*.
*   Therefore, **£12,570 is mathematically optimal** even for Sole Directors, providing you are disciplined enough to pay the NIC bill.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is the most tax-efficient salary for a director in 2025/26?**
For most directors, the sweet spot is **£12,570** per year. This utilizes your full Personal Allowance. Although it triggers some Employer NICs (£1,135), the Corporation Tax savings on the gross salary usually outweigh this cost. If you have the Employment Allowance, it is undeniably the best option.

**Should I take £9,100 or £12,570 salary as a company director?**
In previous years, £9,100 was popular to avoid Employer NICs. However, with the Secondary Threshold dropping to **£5,000** in 2025/26, the £9,100 sweet spot no longer exists. You will pay NICs on anything above £5,000 anyway, so you might as well take the higher £12,570 salary to save more Corporation Tax.

**How to pay yourself as a director?**
You must register as an employer with HMRC and run a robust payroll (RTI). You cannot simply transfer cash and call it salary at the end of the year. It must be reported on or before payday.

## Summary Recommendation

1.  **Check Employment Allowance:** If you can claim it, pay **£12,570**. It's a no-brainer.
2.  **Sole Annual Payroll:** If you are a sole director, paying **£12,570** is still the most efficient route mathematically, saving you ~£200-£300 more than lower salary options, PLUS retaining full Personal Allowance usage for other income (like interest).
3.  **Low Admin:** If you hate paperwork and paying HMRC monthly, settle for **£6,396** to protect your pension, but accept you are leaving tax efficiency on the table.
