# Pension vs Dividends: The Ultimate Wealth Extraction Strategy

<div className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mb-8">April 6, 2025 • 10 min read</div>

When directors ask "How do I take money out of my company?", the answer is usually "Salary and Dividends".
But looking strictly at tax efficiency, **Employer Pension Contributions** blow both of them out of the water.

This guide explains the "Pension Power" strategy: using your company to build personal wealth while paying **zero** immediate tax.

## The Core Difference

### 1. Dividends (Post-Tax)
Dividends are paid from profit *after* Corporation Tax.
*   **Step 1:** Company earns £100.
*   **Step 2:** HMRC takes £19-£25 (Corporation Tax).
*   **Step 3:** You take the remaining ~£80.
*   **Step 4:** HMRC takes Dividend Tax (8.75% - 33.75%).
*   **Result:** You keep £53 - £73.

### 2. Pensions (Pre-Tax)
Pension contributions are an "Allowable Business Expense" (for the most part).
*   **Step 1:** Company earns £100.
*   **Step 2:** Company pays £100 into your SIPP.
*   **Step 3:** Corporation Tax is calculated on £0 Profit.
*   **Step 4:** You pay no Income Tax (until retirement).
*   **Result:** You keep £100 in your pot.

**Mathematically, pensions retain up to 40% more wealth than dividends.**

## The "Pension Salary Sacrifice" Strategy

A "Salary Sacrifice" arrangement isn't just for employees. As a director, you can forgo salary (down to minimum wage) in exchange for direct employer pension contributions.
However, because most directors already take a low salary (£12,570), there isn't much to sacrifice!
The better route is simply making **Employer Contributions** on top of your low salary. This is functionally similar to a **pension salary sacrifice limited company** arrangement for large corporates, but much simpler to administer for your own LTD.

## The "Wholly and Exclusively" Rule

To be tax-deductible, the contribution must be "wholly and exclusively" for the purposes of the trade.
*   For directors, this is rarely challenged as remuneration packages are expected to be substantial.
*   However, if you employ a spouse for admin work on £12k salary and give them a £40k pension contribution, HMRC *will* challenge it as excessive remuneration.

## Limits: The Annual Allowance

You cannot pump infinite money into a pension.
*   **Annual Allowance:** **£60,000** per year (for 2025/26).
*   **Carry Forward:** You can use unused allowances from the previous 3 tax years.
    *   *Potential Total in Year 1:* Up to **£180,000** (if you have sufficient allowance history).

**Crucial Logic for Directors:**
Unlike *personal* contributions (which are limited to your relevant earnings/salary), *employer* contributions are not limited by your salary.
*   You can take a £12,570 salary and have a £60,000 employer pension contribution. This is perfectly legal.

## Case Study: The £100k Problem

Mike runs a consultancy making £140,000 profit.
He needs to extract cash.

**Scenario A: Maximum Dividends**
*   He takes £12,570 Salary.
*   He takes £100,000 Dividends.
*   **Issues:**
    1.  He breaches the £100k Personal Allowance taper (60% effective tax rate).
    2.  He pays Corporation Tax on the full profit (£140k).
    3.  He pays Higher Rate dividend tax.

**Scenario B: The Pension Pivot**
*   He takes £12,570 Salary.
*   He takes £50,000 Dividends (staying in Basic/low Higher rate).
*   He puts **£60,000** into his Pension.

**The Benefits:**
1.  **Corporation Tax:** He saves £60,000 * 26.5% (Marginal Rate) = **£15,900** in tax saved immediately.
2.  **Personal Tax:** His "Adjusted Net Income" drops. He keeps his full Personal Allowance.
3.  **Wealth:** He has £60,000 growing tax-free (compound interest) in a global index tracker.

## The Inheritance Tax (IHT) Bonus

One often overlooked benefit: **Pensions usually fall outside your estate for Inheritance Tax.**
*   If you leave cash in your company = Taxed on death (or extraction).
*   If you take dividends and put cash in bank = Taxed at 40% IHT (above nil rate band).
*   If you put it in a Pension = **0% IHT**. Can be passed to beneficiaries tax-free (if you die before 75).

## Summary Strategy

1.  **Prioritize Pension:** Fill your £60,000 Annual Allowance *before* taking higher-rate dividends.
2.  **Avoid the 60% Trap:** Use pension contributions to keep your net income below £100,000.
3.  **Carry Forward:** If you have a bumper year, look back 3 years to utilize unused allowances.

*Disclaimer: Pensions lock money away until age 57 (from 2028). Only contribute what you won't need for liquidity.*
