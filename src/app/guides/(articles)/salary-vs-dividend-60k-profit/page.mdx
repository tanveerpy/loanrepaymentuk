# Case Study: £60,000 Company Profit

<div className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mb-8">April 6, 2025 • 8 min read</div>

**£60,000** is a pivotal number.
1.  It is above the £50k Small Profits Rate threshold (Corporation Tax rises).
2.  It creates enough income to push a director into the **Higher Rate** tax band if not careful.

This case study shows how to prevent "tax leakage" at this level.

## The Corporation Tax "Marginal Relief" Trap
Since your profit is above £50,000, you are in the **Marginal Relief** band.
*   First £50k is taxed at 19%.
*   The chunk between £50k and £250k is effectively taxed at **26.5%**.

### Step 1: Reduce Taxable Profit
The goal is to get Taxable Profit *below* £50,000 to stick to the 19% rate.

**Strategy:**
*   **Salary:** £12,570.
*   **Employer NIC:** £1,135.
*   **Total Salary Cost:** £13,705.
*   **Taxable Profit:** £60,000 - £13,705 = **£46,295**.

**Success!** Because the salary cost reduced profit below £50k, the company pays just **19%** Corporation Tax.
*   **CT Bill:** £46,295 * 19% = **£8,796**.

---

## Step 2: Distribution
*   **Distributable Profit:** £46,295 - £8,796 = **£37,499**.
*   We declare a dividend of **£37,499**.

---

## Step 3: Personal Tax (The Higher Rate Check)
*   **Salary:** £12,570.
*   **Dividends:** £37,499.
*   **Total Income:** **£50,069**.

**The Higher Rate Threshold is £50,270.**
*   You are **£201** *below* the threshold.
*   This is perfect efficiency. You are engaging the full Basic Rate band (8.75%) without paying a penny at Higher Rate (33.75%).

### Tax Calculation
1.  **Personal Allowance:** £12,570 (Covered).
2.  **Dividend Allowance:** £500 (Free).
3.  **Taxable Dividends:** £36,999.
4.  **Tax @ 8.75%:** £36,999 * 8.75% = **£3,237**.

## Final Result

| Item | Amount |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Cash Out** | £50,069 |
| **Personal Tax** | -£3,237 |
| **Net Cash** | **£46,832** |

*   **Total Tax Paid:** £1,135 (NIC) + £8,796 (CT) + £3,237 (IT) = **£13,168**.
*   **Effective Tax Rate:** ~22%.

---

## What if I had no expenses?
If you did not take a salary, your profit would remain £60,000.
*   **CT:** You would pay 19% on first £50k, and 26.5% on the remaining £10k.
*   **Higher Rate:** The larger dividend would push you into the Higher Rate tax band, costing an extra 25% on that slice.
*   **Taking a Salary is crucial here.**

## Key Takeaway
At £60k profit, the "Salary + Dividend" method is highly effective because the salary deduction keeps your corporation tax low (19%) and your personal income just under the Higher Rate threshold.
