# Case Study: £100,000 Company Profit

<div className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mb-8">April 6, 2025 • 9 min read</div>

Generating **£100,000** in profit is a major milestone.
But it also places you in the most dangerous tax zone in the UK system: **The 60% Trap**.

This guides explains the "Personal Allowance Taper" and how a strategic pension contribution can save you thousands.

---

## The Danger Zone: £100k - £125,140

For every **£2** of "Adjusted Net Income" you earn above £100,000, you lose **£1** of your tax-free Personal Allowance.

**The Math:**
*   **Income Tax Rate:** 40% (Higher Rate).
*   **Lost Allowance:** 20% (Effectively paying 40% on the lost £1).
*   **Combined Effective Rate:** **60%**.

*Note: For dividends, the Higher Rate is 33.75%, so the effective trap rate is 33.75% + 20% = **53.75%**.*

## Scenario A: The "Take It All" Approach (High Tax)

**Director Salary:** £12,570.
**Profit:** £100,000.

### 1. Corporate Level
*   **Salary Cost:** £13,705 (Inc £1,135 Employer NIC).
*   **Taxable Profit:** £86,295.
*   **Corp Tax:** This falls into the Marginal Relief Band (£50k - £250k).
    *   Effective Rate: ~21.7%.
    *   **Tax:** **£18,745**.
*   **Distributable Profit:** £67,550.

### 2. Personal Level
You declare the full £67,550 as a dividend.
*   **Total Income:** £12,570 + £67,550 = **£80,120**.

**Wait... you are SAFE.**
Because Corporation Tax took such a big chunk (£18k+), your personal income is only £80k. You are well below the £100k trap.

**New Problem:**
Ideally, you *want* to extract up to £100k to use the lower bands, but the company doesn't have enough cash after tax!

## Scenario B: Use Pension to Save Corp Tax

Instead of paying Corporation Tax at the Marginal Rate (26.5% on the slice above £50k), you contribute to a pension.

*   **Gross Profit:** £100,000.
*   **Salary:** £12,570.
*   **Pension Contribution:** £40,000.
*   **Employer NIC:** £1,135.
*   **Remaining Profit:** £46,295.

### The Magic
1.  **Corporation Tax:** Your profit is now *below* £50k. You pay the flat **19%**.
    *   Tax: £46,295 * 19% = **£8,796**.
2.  **Dividend:** You take the remaining ~£37,500.

### Total Wealth Comparison

**Scenario A (No Pension):**
*   Net Cash: **£63,000** (approx).
*   Pension: £0.
*   **Total Wealth: £63,000.**

**Scenario B (Pension):**
*   Net Cash: **£46,000**.
*   Pension Pot: **£40,000**.
*   **Total Wealth: £86,000.**

**Result:** The Pension strategy created **£23,000** of extra wealth by legally avoiding Corporation Tax and keeping Personal Tax low.

## Summary
At £100k profit, the main enemy is **Corporation Tax Marginal Relief**.
It destroys your ability to extract cash efficiently.
Prioritize **Employer Pension Contributions** to bring taxable profit down to the £50,000 sweet spot (19% rate).
