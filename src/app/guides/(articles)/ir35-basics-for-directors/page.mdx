# IR35 Basics: Inside vs Outside Explained

<div className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mb-8">April 6, 2025 • 8 min read</div>

**IR35** (Off-Payroll Working) is the tax monster under the bed for UK contractors.
It is designed to stop "disguised employment"—where a worker acts like an employee but operates through a Limited Company to save tax.

## Inside vs Outside: The Difference

### Outside IR35 (The Goal)
You are a genuine business.
*   **Tax:** You pay Corporation Tax, Salary, and Dividends.
*   **Efficiency:** You control your tax rate (approx 19-25%).
*   **Risk:** You take financial risk (e.g., fixing mistakes at your own cost).
*   **Control:** You decide how/when/where the work is done.
*   **Substitution:** You can send someone else to do the work.

### Inside IR35 (Deemed Employee)
HMRC views you as an employee in all but name.
*   **Tax:** The fee payer (client/agency) deducts PAYE & NICs *before* paying your company.
*   **Efficiency:** Zero. You are taxed like an employee (up to 45% + NICs) but get no employment rights (no holiday pay, no pension).
*   **Impact:** Our [Dividend Calculator](/calculator/dividend-vs-salary) becomes irrelevant because you cannot pay dividends from this income.

## Who Decides?

*   **Small Clients:** You (the contractor) decide your status.
*   **Medium/Large Clients:** The Client decides your status (and is liable if they get it wrong).

This shift (April 2021) caused many banks to issue "Blanket Bans" on LTD contractors.

## Key Tests for Status

1.  **Right of Substitution (RoS):** Can you send a substitute? (Ideally, have you actually done it?)
2.  **Control:** Does the client tell you *how* to do the job, or just *what* they need delivered?
3.  **Mutuality of Obligation (MOO):** Are they obliged to offer work? Are you obliged to take it? (Employees have MOO; Contractors shouldn't).

## Strategy for Inside IR35 Contracts

If you are forced "Inside":
1.  **Pension:** Use "Salary Sacrifice". Ask the umbrella/agency to pay directly into your SIPP. This saves the Income Tax and NICs legally.
2.  **Shut Down?** If all your work is Inside IR35, consider closing the LTD (via MVL) and using an Umbrella Company instead to save accountancy fees.

*Disclaimer: IR35 status relies on contract wording AND working practices. Get a professional contract review (e.g., Qdos/Kingsbridge).*
