# Student Loans & Dividends: The Hidden 9% Tax

<div className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mb-8">April 6, 2025 • 8 min read</div>

When you become a company director, you leave behind the world of PAYE student loan deductions.
But the debt doesn't disappear. Instead, it moves to your **Self Assessment Tax Return**.

A critical misunderstanding is that Student Loan repayments are only calculated on *Salary*.
In reality, HMRC calculates repayments based on your **Total Adjusted Net Income**.
This means **Dividends are fully liable**.

If you take a low salary (£12,570) and high dividends (£40,000), your Student Loan repayment will be calculated on the total £52,570.

## 2025/26 Plan Thresholds

Knowing your Plan Type is essential. The thresholds determine when the 9% tax kicks in.

| Plan Type | Annual Threshold | Rate | Who is this? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Plan 1** | £24,990 | 9% | Pre-2012 students (UK/Wales/NI). |
| **Plan 2** | £27,295 | 9% | Post-2012 students (England/Wales). |
| **Plan 4** | £31,395 | 9% | Scottish students. |
| **Plan 5** | £25,000 | 9% | New students (started after Aug 2023). |
| **Postgraduate** | £21,000 | 6% | Masters/MBA students. |

*Note: You can have a Plan 2 AND a Postgraduate loan simultaneously. The deductions stack (15% total marginal rate).*

## The Calculation Logic
HMRC does not look at Salary and Dividends separately. They treat income as a single bucket.

**Formula:**
`(Total Income - Threshold) * 9% = Annual Repayment`

### Case Study: The Surprise Bill
*   **Director:** Sarah (Plan 2).
*   **Salary:** £12,570.
*   **Dividends:** £35,000.
*   **Total Income:** £47,570.

**The Mistake:** Sarah assumes repayment is only on salary. Since £12,570 is below the £27,295 threshold, she thinks she pays **£0**.
**The Reality:**
1.  **Total Income:** £47,570.
2.  **Threshold:** £27,295.
3.  **Liable Income:** £20,275.
4.  **Calculation:** £20,275 * 9% = **£1,824.75**.

**Result:** Sarah gets a tax bill in January for £1,824.75 she didn't save for.

## The "Unearned Income" Threshold Rule
There is a nuanced rule for "Unearned Income" (Dividends/Interest) in Self Assessment.
*   If your unearned income is **below £2,000**, HMRC *may* ignore it for Student Loan purposes in strict coding scenarios, BUT in Self Assessment, it is almost always aggregated.
*   Assume ALL dividends are liable.

## Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Pension Contributions
Employer Pension Contributions are **NOT** income.
*   Sarah considers putting £10,000 into a company pension instead of taking it as a dividend.
*   **New Dividend:** £25,000.
*   **Total Income:** £37,570.
*   **New Liable Income:** £10,275.
*   **New Repayment:** £924.75.
*   **Saving:** **£900** in Student Loan repayments immediately.

### 2. Retain Profits
If you don't need the cash, don't declare the dividend.
Leave the profit in the company. Your income stays lower, and your Student Loan liability drops.

## Postgraduate Loans: The 6% Adder
Postgraduate loans are particularly painful for directors because the threshold is lower (£21,000) and it stacks.

**Example: Plan 2 + Postgraduate**
*   **Income:** £45,000.
*   **Plan 2 Excess:** (£45k - £27,295) * 9% = £1,593.
*   **Postgrad Excess:** (£45k - £21,000) * 6% = £1,440.
*   **Total Repayment:** **£3,033**.
*   **Effective Marginal Tax Rate:** Basic Tax (8.75%) + Plan 2 (9%) + Postgrad (6%) = **23.75%** on dividends.

## Summary
*   **It's not just PAYE:** Dividends attract Student Loan repayments.
*   **Save Monthly:** Calculate your liability using our tool and put the cash in your tax pot.
*   **Use Pensions:** They are the most effective way to lower your "Total Income" and reduce repayments.

*Disclaimer: Voluntary prepayments to SLC do not reduce the compulsory amount calculated by Self Assessment.*
