# Scottish Income Tax Bands 2025/26

<div className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mb-8">April 6, 2025 • 8 min read</div>

For directors living in Scotland (defined by your main residence code 'S' on your tax code), the rules for Income Tax on **non-savings, non-dividend income** are different from the rest of the UK.

However, a crucial distinction often confuses directors: **Dividend Income is taxed at UK rates**, not Scottish rates.

This guide explains how the two systems interact and what it means for your efficiency.

## The 6 Scottish Tax Bands (2025/26)

Scotland has a more progressive system with six distinct bands.

| Band | Income Range | Rate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Personal Allowance** | £0 - £12,570 | 0% |
| **Starter Rate** | £12,571 - £14,876 | 19% |
| **Basic Rate** | £14,877 - £26,561 | 20% |
| **Intermediate Rate** | £26,562 - £43,662 | 21% |
| **Higher Rate** | £43,663 - £75,000 | 42% |
| **Advanced Rate** | £75,001 - £125,140 | 45% |
| **Top Rate** | Above £125,140 | 48% |

*Compare this to England's simple 20% (up to £50,270), 40% and 45% structure.*

## Crucial Rule: Dividends use UK Bands

The Scotland Act allows the Scottish Parliament to set rates on *earned* income (salary, pension, rental). It does **NOT** devolve power over savings or dividend income.

**This is critical for directors:**
*   Your **Salary** is taxed at Scottish Rates (19% - 48%).
*   Your **Dividends** are taxed at UK Rates (8.75% - 39.35%).

## The "Hybrid" Allowances Problem

Even though dividends are UK-taxed, your **Salary uses up the band capacity**. This creates a complex interaction.

### Example: £12,570 Salary in Scotland
If you take the standard £12,570 salary:
1.  **Salary Tax:** £0 (Covered by Personal Allowance).
2.  **Band Usage:** You have used £12,570 of the UK Basic Rate Band (£50,270).
3.  **Remaining Basic Rate for Dividends:** £50,270 - £12,570 = £37,700.

So, for the typical "Low Salary, High Dividend" director, being in Scotland **makes no difference** to your total tax bill regarding the Basic Rate limit, because the UK threshold (£50,270) still dictates when Higher Rate Dividend Tax (33.75%) kicks in.

## Where Scotland Bites: High Earners

If you pay yourself a **high salary** (e.g., inside IR35 or umbrella):
*   You will pay 42% tax above £43,662 (vs 40% above £50,270 in England).
*   You will pay 48% tax above £125,140 (vs 45%).

## Optimal Strategy for Scottish Directors

The advice remains largely consistent with the rest of the UK:
1.  **Keep Salary Low:** £12,570 minimizes Income Tax (0%) and just touches the NIC threshold.
2.  **Take Dividends:** Since these rely on UK bands, you avoid the higher Scottish intermediate/higher rates.
3.  **Watch the Thresholds:** Be aware that while your dividend tax is UK-based, your status as a "Scottish Taxpayer" helps fund public services differently.

*Disclaimer: Check your tax code. If it starts with 'S', these rules apply.*
