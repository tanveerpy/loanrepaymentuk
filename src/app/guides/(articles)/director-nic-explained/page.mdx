# Director National Insurance Explained: 2025/26 Guide

<div className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mb-8">April 6, 2025 • 9 min read</div>

For most employees, National Insurance (NIC) is simple: you earn money in a month, you pay tax on that month.
For **Company Directors**, it works completely differently.

Directors have an **annual earnings period**. This means your NIC liability is calculated based on your total earnings for the *entire tax year*, not just the pay period.

This guide explains the two methods of calculating this (Standard vs Alternative), the 2025/26 Thresholds, and the impact of the new **£5,000 Secondary Threshold**.

## 2025/26 Directors NIC Thresholds

| Threshold Name | Limit (Annual) | Limit (Monthly) | Rate (Director) | Rate (Employer) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lower Earnings Limit (LEL)** | £6,396 | £533 | 0% | 0% |
| **Primary Threshold (PT)** | £12,570 | £1,048 | 8% * | 0% |
| **Secondary Threshold (ST)** | **£5,000** | £417 | 0% | **15%** |
| **Upper Earnings Limit (UEL)** | £50,270 | £4,189 | 2% | 15% |

**Major Change for 2025/26:**
The Employer (Secondary) Threshold has dropped from £9,100 to **£5,000**.
This means employers start paying the **15% tax** much earlier in the salary scale.

*Note: The Employee rate is 8% up to the UEL, then 2% above it.*

## The Annual Earnings Period (Cumulative Method)
*(The "Standard" Director Method)*

Under this method, you pay **£0 National Insurance** until your *cumulative* salary for the year hits the threshold.
Once you cross the threshold, you pay tax on everything above it.

### Example: Salary £24,000 (Paid £2,000/month)
*   **Month 1 (Apr):** Total £2,000. Under £12,570. **NIC: £0.**
*   **Month 2 (May):** Total £4,000. Under £12,570. **NIC: £0.**
*   ...
*   **Month 6 (Sep):** Total £12,000. Still under. **NIC: £0.**
*   **Month 7 (Oct):** Total £14,000. You have crossed the £12,570 threshold by £1,430. **NIC Payable: £114.**
*   **Month 8+:** You pay 8% on the full £2,000 each month.

**Pros:** Cashflow advantage early in the year.
**Cons:** Uneven net pay. You take home more in months 1-6 and less in months 7-12.

## The Table Method (Alternative Method)
*(Treating yourself like an employee)*

Many payroll software packages default to this because it gives a consistent net salary.
You calculate NICs each month *as if* the director has a monthly earnings period (1/12th of the annual thresholds).

### The "Month 12" Wash-Up
Crucially, if you use this method, you **MUST** recalculate the liability on an annual basis in the final payroll (Month 12).
*   If you overpaid or underpaid compared to the Standard Method, the adjustment is made in March.

**When does this matter?**
If you pay yourself a **Bonus**.
*   *Table Method:* You pay NIC on the bonus in that month only (capped at Upper Earnings Limit for that month).
*   *Standard Method:* The bonus is added to annual income. If you haven't used your full annual 8% band, you might pay more NIC than expected. The "Wash-Up" ensures the Standard Method result is always enforced eventually.

## The Employer NIC "Shock"

The reduction of the Secondary Threshold to £5,000 is the biggest headline of 2025.
A director on a **£12,570 salary** will see a significant new cost.

### Calculation
*   Salary: £12,570.
*   Threshold: £5,000.
*   Taxable Amount: £7,570.
*   Rate: 15%.
*   **Liability: £1,135.50**.

**Question: Can I avoid this?**
1.  **Lower Salary:** Reduce salary to £5,000. (Saves the £1,135, but wastes £7,570 of Personal Allowance corporation tax deduction).
2.  **Employment Allowance:** If you have another employee (earning >£5k), claim the £10,500 allowance to wipe this £1,135 out.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**I am a sole director. Can I use the Annual Method?**
Yes. In fact, you *must* legally be assessed cumulatively by the end of the year. The choice is whether you smooth it out (Table) or take the hit later (Standard).

**Does this affect Dividends?**
No. NICs apply strictly to *Salary* and *Bonuses*. Dividends are exempt.

**What happens if I leave the company mid-year?**
Because of the annual period, if you pay yourself £12,570 in Month 1 and then quit, you have used your *full annual allowance*. You won't get a NIC refund, whereas an employee on the monthly system might.

## Summary
*   **Method:** Choose "Table Method" for consistent cashflow, "Standard" for deferring tax.
*   **Thresholds:** Watch out for the £5,000 Employer limit.
*   **Qualifying Years:** Ensure you earn at least £6,396 (LEL) to keep your State Pension record intact.
