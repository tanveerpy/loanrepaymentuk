# Can I Pay Dividends if My Company Makes a Loss?

<div className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mb-8">April 6, 2025 • 6 min read</div>

A common question during tough trading years is: *"I have money in the business bank account; can I take a dividend even though we made a loss this year?"*

The answer depends on one crucial figure: **Retained Earnings**.

## The Golden Rule: Distributable Profits

You can legally pay dividends **only if** you have sufficient "Distributable Profits".
Distributable Profits = **Accumulated Profits (from all years) - Accumulated Losses.**

It does **not** matter if you have cash in the bank. Cash is not profit. Cash could be from a bounce-back loan, a VAT bill you haven't paid yet, or a customer deposit.

### Scenario A: Current Year Loss, but Historic Profit
*   Year 1 Profit: £50,000 (Retained)
*   Year 2 Loss: -£10,000
*   **Total Distributable Profit:** £40,000.
*   **Result:** ✅ You CAN legally pay up to £40,000 in dividends.

### Scenario B: Current Year Profit, but Historic Loss
*   Year 1 Loss: -£50,000
*   Year 2 Profit: +£20,000
*   **Total Distributable Profit:** -£30,000.
*   **Result:** ❌ You CANNOT pay dividends, even though you made money this year. You must fill the "hole" from Year 1 first.

## What is an "Ultra Vires" (Illegal) Dividend?

If you pay a dividend without sufficient profit, it is classified as **Ultra Vires** (beyond powers).

### The Consequences
1.  **Reclassification to Loan:** HMRC may treat the payment as a Director's Loan.
2.  **S455 Tax:** If not repaid within 9 months of year-end, the company pays **33.75%** tax on the loan.
3.  **Insolvency Risk:** If the company goes bust, the liquidator will demand you repay this money personally. It is not protected by "Limited Liability" because it was taken illegally.

## What To Do If You Are In Loss

If you cannot pay dividends involving profits, you must pay yourself a **Salary**.
*   Salary is a business expense. It can be paid even if the company makes a loss (increasing the loss).
*   However, salary attracts National Insurance and Income Tax.

## Summary Checklist
Before declaring a dividend:
1.  Run up-to-date management accounts.
2.  Deduct estimated Corporation Tax.
3.  Check the "Retained Earnings" line on the Balance Sheet.
4.  Ensure it is positive and covers the dividend amount.

*Disclaimer: Always document your dividend declaration with a Board Minute/Voucher.*
