# Case Study: £150,000 Company Profit

<div className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mb-8">April 6, 2025 • 8 min read</div>

With **£150,000** of profit, you are a "High Earner".
You face the triple threat:
1.  **Additional Rate Tax:** 45% (Salary) or 39.35% (Dividend).
2.  **Loss of Personal Allowance:** Reduced to £0.
3.  **Corporation Tax:** Deep in the Marginal Relief band (26.5% effective).

---

## The "Do Nothing" Disaster
If you simply withdraw everything:
*   **Corp Tax:** ~£35,000 (roughly).
*   **Personal Income:** ~£115,000.
*   **Tax Trap:** You lose most of your Personal Allowance.
*   **Effective Tax Rate:** Over 50% combined.

---

## Strategy: The £100k Ceiling

The "Goldilocks" zone for high earners is keeping Adjusted Net Income at exactly **£100,000**.
Why?
*   You keep your full Personal Allowance (£12,570).
*   You avoid the 60% Tax Trap.
*   You avoid the 45% Additional Rate.

### How to achieve this with £150k Profit?

**Step 1: Salary**
Take **£12,570**.

**Step 2: Dividends**
Take **£87,430**.
*   This brings total income to **£100,000**.
*   You pay Higher Rate tax (33.75%), but you keep your Personal Allowance.

**Step 3: The Surplus**
After paying Salary and Dividends, your company still has profit left.
*   **Gross:** £150,000.
*   **Salary Cost:** -£13,700.
*   **Dividends:** -£87,430.
*   **Corporation Tax:** Paid on the profit.
*   **Surplus:** ~£20,000 - £30,000 cash remains in the bank.

**What to do with the surplus?**
1.  **Pension:** Dump it into a SIPP (up to £60k annual allowance). This wipes out Corp Tax on that chunk.
2.  **Electric Vehicle:** Lease a Porsche Taycan or Tesla through the company. Benefit in Kind is tiny (2%), but the lease cost offsets Corporation Tax.
3.  **Money Boxing:** Leave it for a future year (e.g., a sabbatical year where you take no salary, or for a future detailed liquidation).

## The Spouse Strategy (Advanced)
If you have a spouse, split the equity (e.g., 50/50 shares).
*   Profit: £150,000.
*   Allocated to You: £75,000.
*   Allocated to Spouse: £75,000.
*   **Result:** BOTH of you are Basic/Higher Rate taxpayers. Neither of you hits the £100k trap. The tax savings are **massive** (potentially £20k+ per year).

*Warning: "Settlements legislation" applies. The transfer of shares must be an outright gift with no strings attached, and ideally done when the company is structured.*

## Summary
At £150k, **do not take it all**.
Stop at £100k personal income. The tax friction above this line is too high.
Redirect the excess into **Pensions** or **Assets**.
