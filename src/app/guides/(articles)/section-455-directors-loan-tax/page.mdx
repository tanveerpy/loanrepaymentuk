# Section 455 Tax: The Director's Loan Account Penalty

<div className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mb-8">April 6, 2025 • 7 min read</div>

Company money is not your money.
If you withdraw cash from your limited company that is not a Salary or a Dividend, it is classified as a **Director's Loan**.

Borrowing from your company can be a useful short-term tool, but if you don't play by the rules, HMRC hits you with a specific penalty tax: **Section 455**.

## What is S455 Tax?

If a director (or participator) owes money to the company **9 months and 1 day** after the company's financial year-end, the company must pay S455 tax on the outstanding balance.

*   **Rate:** **33.75%** of the outstanding amount.
*   **Who pays it?** The *Company* pays it (not you personally).
*   **Is it permanent?** No. It is a "deposit" held by HMRC. You get it back when you repay the loan.

---

## The 9-Month Rule

*   **Year End:** 31 March 2026.
*   **Deadline:** 1 January 2027 (9 months + 1 day).

If you repay the loan *before* this date, no tax is due.
If you repay it *after*, the tax is payable.

### Example
*   You borrow £20,000 on 1 June 2025 to buy a car.
*   You repay it on 1 December 2025.
*   **Result:** No S455 Tax.

*   You borrow £20,000.
*   You haven't repaid it by 1 January 2027.
*   **Result:** Company pays £6,750 tax (33.75%).

## Benefit in Kind (The Interest Rule)

If the loan is above **£10,000** and you don't pay interest to the company, HMRC treats the "interest-free" nature of the loan as a taxable perk (Benefit in Kind).
*   You must report it on a P11D.
*   You pay Class 1A National Insurance on the "official rate of interest" (approx 2.25%).

**Solution:** The company should charge you interest (at the HMRC official rate) which you must physically pay.

---

## Anti-Avoidance: Bed and Breakfasting

Directors used to repay the loan on 31 December and borrow it back on 2 January to avoid the tax.
HMRC blocked this.
*   **The 30-Day Rule:** If you repay a loan and withdraw it again within 30 days, tax relief is denied.
*   **The Intent Rule:** Even outside 30 days, if there is a pre-arranged plan to borrow it back, relief is restricted.

## Summary Checklist
1.  **Clear Balance:** Try to clear your Director's Loan Account (DLA) before the year-end (using a Dividend declaration).
2.  **Deadline:** If you can't, ensure it is cleared within 9 months.
3.  **Charge Interest:** If the loan >£10k, pay interest to avoid BIK.

*Disclaimer: S455 tax is refundable, but claiming it back takes months. Avoid paying it in the first place.*
