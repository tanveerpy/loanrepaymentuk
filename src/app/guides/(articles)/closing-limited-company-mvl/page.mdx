# Closing Your Company: MVL vs Strike Off

<div className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mb-8">April 6, 2025 • 7 min read</div>

All good things come to an end. Maybe you are accepting a permanent role (Inside IR35) or retiring to Spain.
You have £100,000 sitting in your business bank account. How do you get it out?

You have two main routes: **Strike Off** or **Members Voluntary Liquidation (MVL)**.

---

## Route 1: Strike Off (DS01)
*   **Best for:** Reserves under £25,000.
*   **Cost:** £10 (payable to Companies House).

Also known as dissolution. You simply apply to strike the company off the register.
*   **Tax Rule:** If reserves are **under £25,000**, the whole amount is treated as Capital Gains (Capital distribution).
*   **Benefit:** You use your Capital Gains Allowance (£3,000) and pay 10% (BADR) or 10%/20% CGT on the rest.

**The Trap:**
If you have **£25,001** or more, the *entire amount* is treated as an Income Dividend.
*   £25,001 dividend -> Taxed at up to 39.35%.
*   **Disaster.**

---

## Route 2: Members Voluntary Liquidation (MVL)
*   **Best for:** Reserves over £25,000.
*   **Cost:** £2,000 - £4,000 (Liquidator fees).

An MVL is a formal legal process run by a licensed Insolvency Practitioner (IP).
*   **Benefit:** The IP distributes the funds to you as **Capital**, regardless of the amount (e.g., £200,000).
*   **Tax:** You apply **Business Asset Disposal Relief** (BADR - formerly Entrepreneur's Relief).
*   **The Rate:** **10%** (on the first £1m lifetime limit).

### The Math: £100k Extraction
| Method | Tax Rate | Tax Bill | Net Cash |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dividend** | 33.75% (Higher) | ~£33,000 | £67,000 |
| **MVL (BADR)** | 10% | £10,000 + £3k Fee | **£87,000** |

**Using an MVL saves you £20,000.**

## Anti-Avoidance: TAAR (The "Phoenixing" Rule)
You cannot close a company via MVL (paying 10% tax) and then open a new company doing the *same trade* within 2 years.
*   This is known as **Phoenixing**.
*   If caught, HMRC reclassifies the MVL distribution as Dividends (Income Tax).
*   **Safe:** If you are retiring, moving sector, or taking a permanent PAYE job.

## Summary
*   **Under £25k:** Strike Off (DIY).
*   **>£25k:** MVL (Hire a liquidator).
*   **Phoenixing:** Don't start a new Ltd for 2 years.

*Disclaimer: Liquidation is a legal process. You must pay all creditors first.*
