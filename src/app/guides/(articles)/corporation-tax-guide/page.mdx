# Corporation Tax 2025/26: The Hidden 26.5% Rate

<div className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mb-8">April 6, 2025 • 6 min read</div>

Since April 2023, the simple 19% Corporation Tax rate is gone for many companies. It has been replaced by a tiered system that can create an effective marginal tax rate of **26.5%** on some profits.

## The Three Bands

1.  **Small Profits Rate (19%):** Applies to profits up to **£50,000**.
2.  **Main Rate (25%):** Applies to profits above **£250,000**.
3.  **Marginal Relief Band:** Applies to profits between £50,000 and £250,000.

## Understanding Marginal Relief

If your profit falls in the "buffer zone" (£50k - £250k), you don't pay 25% on everything. Instead, you pay 25% reduced by *Marginal Relief*.

However, the math often works out to a **marginal rate of 26.5%** on the profits within this band.

### Example: £100,000 Profit
*   First £50,000 is effectively taxed lower.
*   The next £50,000 suffers the catch-up rate.
*   Total Tax: ~£22,750 (Effective rate: 22.75%).

## Impact on Dividends

Corporation Tax is paid *before* dividends are distributed.
*   Higher Corp Tax = Less Profit Available for Dividends.
*   This is why accurate calculation is vital. Our [calculator](/calculator/dividend-vs-salary) automatically handles Marginal Relief to give you the exact distributable profit.

## Planning Tips
*   **Pension Contributions:** Employers pension contributions are deducted *before* tax, saving you 19-25% Corporation Tax instantly.
*   **Expenses:** Ensure all allowable expenses are claimed to reduce taxable profit.

*Disclaimer: Associated companies can reduce these thresholds. Consult an accountant.*
