# About the Director Tax Engine

<div className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mb-8">Established 2025</div>

The **Director Salary vs Dividend Optimization Engine** was built to solve a specific problem: **Accuracy**.

Most online calculators are "black boxes". They spit out a number without explaining how they got there. They often ignore critical variables like:
*   Marginal Relief for Corporation Tax.
*   The Annual Earnings Period for Directors NICs.
*   Student Loan repayment thresholds on dividend income.

We built this tool to be different. We built it to be **transparent**, **precise**, and **optimised** for the 2025/26 and 2026/27 tax years.

## Our Philosophy: Trust Through Transparency

We don't just give you a number. We show you the math. Every calculation comes with a breakdown, and our [How It Works](/guides/how-it-works) guide explains the exact formulas used.

## Data Accuracy

Our tax data is sourced directly from **HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC)** and is updated within 48 hours of any Budget announcement.
*   **Current Tax Year:** 2025/26 (Confirmed).
*   **Future Tax Year:** 2026/27 (Forecast based on Autumn Budget statements).

## Disclaimer

While we strive for perfection, we are a software tool, not a human accountant. We provide **estimates for planning purposes**. Always verify your final strategy with a qualified professional.
