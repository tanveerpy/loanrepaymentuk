# Editorial Policy

<div className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mb-8">Last Updated: April 6, 2025</div>

## Accuracy First
Our primary commitment is to the accuracy of our tax data.
1.  **Primary Sources:** We verify all rates against official **GOV.UK** documentation and Treasury Budget documents.
2.  **Verification:** Every calculator update is audited against valid test cases.
3.  **Corrections:** If we make a mistake, we correct it immediately and transparently.

## Independence
We are an independent publisher. We are not owned by an accounting firm or a bank.
*   Our content is not pay-to-play.
*   We do not recommend products we don't believe in.

## Financial Advice Warning
Our content is for **informational purposes only**. It constitutes educational material, not financial advice. Tax laws are complex and subject to individual circumstances. Always consult a qualified accountant before making financial decisions.
