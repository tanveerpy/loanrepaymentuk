## 1. The Short Version
**We do not store your financial data.** 
When you enter your salary or profit figures into our calculator, that processing happens locally in your browser or ephemerally on our server to generate the result. We do not save it to a database.

## 2. Cookies
We use essential cookies to make the site work (e.g., remembering your dark mode preference). We may use anonymous analytics (like Google Analytics) to see which pages are popular. You can opt-out of analytics cookies via your browser settings.

## 3. Local Storage
We may save your "Scenario" inputs to your browser's `localStorage` so that when you refresh the page, your data is still there. This data never leaves your device.

## 4. Advertising
We may display non-intrusive advertisements (e.g., Google AdSense) to keep this tool free. These 3rd-party vendors may use cookies to serve ads based on your prior visits.

## 5. Contact
If you have questions, please contact us at: support@directortax.com
